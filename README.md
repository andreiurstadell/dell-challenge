# Dell Technical Challenges

## Technical Challenge presentation:
* There are 4 projects in the DellChallenge solution and each one has a series of problems that need to be solved;
* The first three projects (_A, B, C_) are aiming for coding best practices and standards;
* Project _D1_ aims to verify the backend skills in developing RESTful Web APIs;
  * _hint_: use `/swagger` endpoint for checking methods;
* Placeholder _DellChallenge.D2.Spa_ is a bonus challenge that aims to verify the frontend skills in developing SPA;
* Please try and solve as much as possible of the challenges in their order;
* There is no need for connecting to a database, feel free to use the already implemented in memory one;
